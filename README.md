# INTRODUCTION
This app is a game based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. I decided to give it a twist by using three Marvel heroes (well, 2 heroes and 1 bad guy, I ought to say). 

# EXPERIENCE (UX)
The target audience: Mainly, adults and children who like playing games on their phones and like the Marvel movies.

## User Stories
1. First Time Visitor Goals

   - I want the rules to be easy to grasp (is this based on Rock Paper Scissors?)
   - I want to know my score against the computer

2. Returning Visitor Goals

   - I want to play again because I like the graphics
   - I want to get a higher score (although I'm aware it's based on chance)
 
3. Frequent User Goals

   - I want to see if there is any added features
   - I'm a fan of the Avengers, so who REALLY is the strongest Marvel character? I want more information

## Design

I chose the Marvel theme for the game so it made sense to go for a science-fiction/Avengers look.

2. Typography

   
3. Imagery
