# INTRODUCTION
This application is a game based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. I decided to give it a twist by using three Marvel heroes (well, 2 heroes and 1 bad guy, I ought to say!). Based on the Avengers movies, I decided that
   - Thor > Hulk but < Loki
   - Hulk > Loki but < Thor
   - Loki > Thor but < Hulk

Of course, the above is very debatable. I based my research on the following articles, mostly found on the Screenrant website: 

- [Hulk vs Thor: Who the Most Powerful Was in the Avengers 2012](https://screenrant.com/avengers-2012-movie-hulk-thor-most-powerful-reason/)
 - [10 Times Loki Proved He Was The Strongest Asgardian](https://www.cbr.com/loki-strongest-asgardian-mcu/)
 - [Loki Names One Avenger Strong Enough To Kill Thor (And It's Not Hulk)](https://screenrant.com/loki-avenger-kill-thor-hercules-not-hulk/)

 Finally, some images from the movies:

# EXPERIENCE (UX)
The target audience: Mainly, adults and children who like playing games on their phones and like the Marvel movies.

## User Stories
1. First Time Visitor Goals
   - I want the rules to be easy to grasp (is this based on Rock Paper Scissors?)
   - I want to know my score against the computer

2. Returning Visitor Goals

   - I want to get a higher score (although I'm aware it's based on chance)

3. Frequent User Goals

## Design

As the game is based on Marvel characters, I chose a science-fiction/Avengers look. 

1. Colour Scheme

   I picked the colors from the background: a dark blue, hints of orange and greeny-beige, constrating with white (for accessibility reasons). 
 <div style="text-align: center;"> 
 <img src="docs/colors.png" alt="color palette for Marvel Battle - dark blue, orange, white, beige">

2. Typography

   I wanted fonts that looked futuristic.  I picked Orbitron for titles and Exo for the text. These fonts were suggested in this site:
   [25+ Best Sci-Fi and Techno Fonts for Futuristic Designs](https://superdevresources.com/techno-sci-fi-fonts/)

3. Imagery

The 'wallpaper' image I chose for the background consists of two merged illustrations: Hulk at the front and Thor fighting with Loki at the back). The image sets the mood: They are fighting in a dramatic and dark environment. The illustrations are based on the Avengers movies (and actors). 
The 3 buttons in the 'Controls' div of the Game section are images representing the weapons: the game "rock-paper-scissors" is almost always represented by graphics (hand gestures).

## Wireframes
I kept the design very simple as it is a simple game, almost intuitive: Like all 'rock-paper-scissors' game apps, it needs 3 buttons to play and a score-board, and that's about it. I explain the rules at the top. The 'register' section was added later.
