# INTRODUCTION
This application is a game based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. I decided to give it a twist by using three Marvel heroes (well, 2 heroes and 1 bad guy, I ought to say!). Based on the Avengers movies, I decided that
   - Thor > Hulk but < Loki
   - Hulk > Loki but < Thor
   - Loki > Thor but < Hulk
And those extracts from the movies:
   

Of course, the above is very debatable. I based my research on the following articles, mostly found on the Screenrant website: 

- [Hulk vs Thor: Who the Most Powerful Was in the Avengers 2012](https://screenrant.com/avengers-2012-movie-hulk-thor-most-powerful-reason/)
 - [10 Times Loki Proved He Was The Strongest Asgardian](https://www.cbr.com/loki-strongest-asgardian-mcu/)
 - [Loki Names One Avenger Strong Enough To Kill Thor (And It's Not Hulk)](https://screenrant.com/loki-avenger-kill-thor-hercules-not-hulk/)

 Finally, some images from the movies:

## Design
